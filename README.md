## Introduction:
The problem of counting number of object instances visible in a single image becomes even more chellenging in highly dense scenarios which include additional complexity due to factors like perspective, occlusion, clutter, and few pixels per object. 
In extremely dense populations, counting by human detection in such images is almost impossible.

The objective of this project is to address this problem by going throuth 4 stages: 

### 1) Selection and analysis of a deep learning model using Keras
The selected model is based on the paper ['Towards perspective-free object counting with deep learning' by Daniel Oñoro-Rubio and Roberto J. López-Sastre.](http://agamenon.tsc.uah.es/Investigacion/gram/publications/eccv2016-onoro.pdf)

The detailed process can be found in the notebook [i_model_selection](https://github.com/jorgealcubilla/TFM_DataScience/blob/master/master/i_model_selection.ipynb) within the 'master' folder of this project.

### 2) Data_set: Selection and validation
This project will use the 'TRaffic ANd COngestionS (TRANCOS)' dataset which is used by the aforementioned paper in its section# '4.1'.

TRANCOS is a dataset designed for vehicle counting in traffic jam scenes, so, it is a perfect fit for this project.

For further information and instructions on how to download this dataset properly, see notebook [ii_TRANCOS_db](https://github.com/jorgealcubilla/TFM_DataScience/blob/master/master/ii_TRANCOS_db.ipynb) within the 'master' folder of this project.

### 3) selected model test


### 4) practical application
